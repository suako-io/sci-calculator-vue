# Suako Calc

Scientific calculator built with [Vue](https://vuejs.org), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org),[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and [math.js](https://mathjs.org/).

I am new to Typescript so am still learning, future updates will hopefully refactor a lot of the janky code that could be improved with better Typescript implementation.

## TO-DO
- ~~Add the ability to multiply by a power,~~
- Radians and Degrees toggle button,

- ~~Factorials,~~
- ~~Inverse functions button,~~
- Add breakpoints / media queries to account for smaller devices
